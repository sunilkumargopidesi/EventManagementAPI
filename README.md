# EventManagementAPI
EventManagementAPI Project Assignment


Steps for implementing project:




Certainly. I'll provide a step-by-step process to implement this ASP.NET Core project for managing events. This guide will cover setting up the project, implementing the required features, and preparing it for submission.
Step 1: Set up the project

Open Visual Studio 2022 (or the latest version available).
Click on "Create a new project".
Choose "ASP.NET Core Web API" and click Next.
Name your project (e.g., "EventManagementAPI") and choose a location.
Select the latest stable .NET version (e.g., .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0).
Ensure "Use controllers" is checked and "Enable OpenAPI support" is selected.
Click Create.

Step 2: Set up the database

Open the Package Manager Console.
Install required packages:

CopyInstall-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

In appsettings.json, add your connection string:

jsonCopy"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=EventManagementDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
Step 3: Create models

Create a Models folder in your project.
Add User.cs and Event.cs files:

csharpCopy// User.cs
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
    public string Role { get; set; }
}

// Event.cs
public class Event
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime Date { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string Organizer { get; set; }
}
Step 4: Create DbContext

Create a Data folder.
Add ApplicationDbContext.cs:

csharpCopyusing Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Event> Events { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<User>()
            .HasIndex(u => u.Username)
            .IsUnique();
    }
}

In Program.cs, add:

csharpCopybuilder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

Run migrations:

CopyAdd-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
Step 5: Implement Repository Pattern

Create a Repositories folder.
Add IRepository.cs, IUserRepository.cs, and IEventRepository.cs interfaces.
Implement UserRepository.cs and EventRepository.cs.

Step 6: Create DTOs

Create a DTOs folder.
Add UserDto.cs, LoginDto.cs, EventDto.cs, etc.

Step 7: Implement Services

Create a Services folder.
Add IUserService.cs and IEventService.cs interfaces.
Implement UserService.cs and EventService.cs.

Step 8: Implement Controllers

In the Controllers folder, add UsersController.cs and EventsController.cs.
Implement the required endpoints as specified in the requirements.

Step 9: Set up Authentication and Authorization

Install required packages:

CopyInstall-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer

Configure JWT authentication in Program.cs.
Implement JWT token generation in UserService.

Step 10: Implement Input Validation

Use Data Annotations in your DTOs.
Implement custom validation if needed.

Step 11: Error Handling

Implement global exception handling middleware.

Step 12: Write Unit Tests

Create a new xUnit test project.
Write tests for controllers and services.

Step 13: Set up Swagger

Configure Swagger in Program.cs.
Add XML comments to your controllers for better documentation.

Step 14: Create README.md

Write a comprehensive README file with setup and run instructions.

Step 15: Final touches

Review and refactor your code for clarity and efficiency.
Ensure all requirements are met.
Run all tests and make sure they pass.

Step 16: Push to GitHub

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder.
Create a new repository on GitHub.
Push your code to the GitHub repository.

This step-by-step process covers the main points of implementing the project. Each step involves more detailed coding and configuration. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation?




DTOfOLDER inframetion and working funtinalitiy 

These DTOs cover the main operations for user management and event management as specified in your requirements:

UserDto: For general user information (without sensitive data like password)
RegisterUserDto: For user registration
LoginDto: For user login
EventDto: For general event information
CreateEventDto: For creating a new event
UpdateEventDto: For updating an existing event
EventSearchDto: For searching events

The DTOs include some basic validation attributes (like [Required] and [StringLength]) to ensure data integrity. You may want to add more specific validation rules based on your exact requirements.
Remember to use these DTOs in your controllers and services instead of directly exposing your domain models. This practice helps to:

Control what data is exposed to the client
Separate your internal data model from your API contract
Provide a clear structure for input validation

You can use a library like AutoMapper to easily map between your domain models and these DTOs in your application logic.
